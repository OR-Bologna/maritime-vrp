Maritime VRP
============

Intro
-----

This project is part of my Master Thesis. The code has been written from scratch, but often in a hurry and lacks proper documentation. It is a solver for a quite particular case of VRP with:

* Multiple time windows
* Pickups and deliveries
* Heterogeneous fleet
* Multiple sailing speeds (and costs)
* Maximum transit times
